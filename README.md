# ujkuo's dotfiles

This is my terminal settings on M2 Macbook Air.

I use (iTerm2)[https://iterm2.com], (zsh)[https://www.zsh.org],
(oh-my-zsh)[https://ohmyz.sh], (tmux)[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki],
(neovim)[https://neovim.io] and
(vim)[https://www.vim.org] (for some times) to improve my workflow.

It's welcome to use my dotfiles ***if you know what that entails***;
do not blindly clone everything.
